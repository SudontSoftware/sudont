# SUDON'T
Don't `sudo`.

This project is meant to make CLI tools faster to access.   
It removes `sudo` and also makes the CLI tool name shorter.   
For example, `sudo pacman` -> `pac`.

## Installation
Installing is simple:
1. Download the project/installer.sh file!
2. Run it!
3. Done!
### Updating
Because this is a bleeding edge project, it is recommended to frequently update.
You can update through the cli tool:
```
sudont update
```
